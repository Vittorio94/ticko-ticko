# Typography planning
- font selection (regular, bold)
- size (tiny, medium, big)
- color (must work with hex as well as theme colors)
- text decorations (underline, strike through)
- link functionality (works like an html link basically)
- text alignment
- text direction (maybe)
- text background color
